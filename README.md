# Tie the Knot Wedding Planner
*Tie the Knot is a website designed to assist users who are planning their wedding and need to keep track of their To Do list, their Payments and their Guest List.*

## Purpose and Value

#### User Goal
To use a website to assist the planning of their wedding.

#### Website Goal
For users to be able to keep track of their wedding information with ease.

#### User Stories
> A couple who both come from big families would like a wedding planner website to keep track of who has been invited, any dietary needs and what tables everyone will be sat at.

> A couple who are planning a classic big white wedding and need a wedding planner website to organise their To Do list, including keeping track of what payments need to be made and when.

## Competitor Review

For this project, I had a look at two wedding planning websites:
* Hitched Wedding Planner
* Bridebook Wedding Planner

**Hitched Wedding Planner**

Pros:
* When you first log on, it has the couple's names, which makes the website feel really personalised.

Cons:
* There's a lot of information on the Dashboard page, making it quite overwhelming, and doesn't give an accurate overview of features.

**Bridebook Wedding Planner**

Pros:
* Guests can be grouped by family. Dashboard has some great colours and easy to read cards to take you to each page

Cons: 
* Articles and adverts for suppliers not clearly titled on the home page. The Dashboard page would have made a much better home page.

| Objective           | Importance | Viability / Feasibility | To be added |
|------------|------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Users able to add, update & delete their guest list       |  5  |   4   |  :heavy_check_mark:  |
| Users able to add, update & delete their to do list     |  5     |  5    | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Users able to set a budget and add, update and delete their wedding costs    |  3  |  3   | :heavy_check_mark:   |
| Users able to see when payments need to be made  |  4  |  4  |  |
| Users able to see what table their guests are sat on   |   4    |  3   | :heavy_check_mark: *    |

Table numbers will be added to the Guest List page. However, I would like to add a page specifically for showing the table numbers and the guests assigned to them on individual cards. In future updates I would also like to add the budget feature, so users can keep track of payments and budgets in one place.

## Structure

I started drafting my ideas for structure on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). I created my wireframes next on [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), and then moved back to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create my prototype.

I've chosen to have a home page that promotes the features of the website. The user will be prompted to log in or sign up, and the pages for these will come straight from the home page.

Once logged in, the user will have their own dashboard. From here they can see their Checklist, from which they can add, edit and delete checklist items. They can also access their Guest list from the Dashboard, and add, edit or delete their Guests. The last page will filter any items in the Checklist with the "Payment" field ticked, so users can keep track of their payments.
